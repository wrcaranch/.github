Join us for the 28th Annual World Championship Ranch Rodeo. In March of 1995, a group of people from across the western United States created the Working Ranch Cowboys Association. WRCA produces the World Championship Ranch Rodeo as a means to showcase the skills of the working ranch cowboy and to raise funds for the WRCA Foundation.
